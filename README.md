# data_vis

This project visualizes total PFAS concentrations found in a study done by the Keller Research Team in 12 Southern California watersheds. The data is visualized with LOEC data for each PFAS, as well as with tabulated global wastewater treatment concentration data from the literature.

**data:**

ecotoxicological data: `ecotoxdata.xlsx` and `loec.xlsx` from ECOTOX

tabulated data: `pfa_global_wwtp.xlsx`

concentration data: `pfa_concentration_data_krt.xlsx`

**R script:**
